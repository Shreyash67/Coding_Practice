ğŸ§  Problem 3: Count the Good Pairs

Arjun has a list of integers. He considers a pair (i, j) as good if:

i < j and

nums[i] == nums[j]

Your task is to count how many good pairs are there in the list.

ğŸ§© Input: A list of integers
ğŸ§© Output: An integer â€” total good pairs

ğŸ”¢ Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3]
Good pairs: (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) â†’ Total = 4
Output: 4
