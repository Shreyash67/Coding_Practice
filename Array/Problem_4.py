ðŸ§  Problem 4: Maximum Consecutive Ones

Kabir is working with binary data (0s and 1s). He wants to find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in the list.

ðŸ§© Input: A list of 0s and 1s
ðŸ§© Output: An integer â€” length of longest sequence of 1s

ðŸ”¢ Example:
Input: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
Output: 3 (because 1,1,1 is the longest consecutive 1s)
